So the gist of the ideas are as follows:

--> Histogram of pledges to the the number of projects in that pledge range.
--> Histogram of time duration of projects
--> Evolution of a project w.r.t. time for a recurring project
--> Evolution of category over time (Overall/ Geographically distributed)
--> Geographic distribution of projects (overall/per category)
--> Geographic distribution of pledges/projects (overall/per category)
